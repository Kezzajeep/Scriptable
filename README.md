    * Big thanks to [juniorchen](https://github.com/Juniorchen2012/scriptable) for the base of the progress bar portion of the code. You can check the progress widget out [here](https://github.com/Juniorchen2012/scriptable/blob/master/progress.js)

* ### [Transparent StockChange Widget](Transparent%20StockChange.js)
    * Credit for the original code base for this widget goes to [Murdo](https://github.com/CaptainMurdo/Scriptable/blob/master/StockPrice.js). I helped him to modify it to have dynamic column creation for adding more stocks in. I have also just made an update for this so it can have a transparent background using no-background.js from Supermamon.

* ### [Upcoming Calendar Events Widget](Upcoming%20Calendar%20Widget.js)

      ![example1](https://i.imgur.com/B5N98lW.jpg) ![example2](https://i.imgur.com/rCgF54y.jpg)

* ### [Upcoming Calendar Indicator](Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator)
     
    * **Credit goes to [Raigo Jerva](https://gist.github.com/rudotriton/b51d227c3d1d9cb497829ae45583224f#instructions) for the original code that I modified to create the base of the view for the right side of the widget.**
        Inspiration was drawn from a comment on one of the r/Scriptable subreddit posts, but I cannot find it any longer. 
    * This widget is similar to my Upcoming Calendar widget, but this now has a display for the full month view with indicators of up to five calendar colors for each day.

* ### [Twitter Widget](Twitter%20Widget.js)
    * ##### As of v1.4 there are new error messages available. Unfortunately, the Twitter API changed some things and this broke the widget code. This is now accounted for.
    * This widget can display tweets from public profiles on your home screen and shows them to you in chronological order as well as how long ago (or on what date) the tweet was posted. This can be configured as a medium or large size widget for your own preference. Simply set the username you'd like to "follow" in the widget parameter, and you'll be all set.
